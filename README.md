# Download a video in Parts 
Download a Specific file in parts using Alamofire

Inspired from WhatsApp and othe Applicaitons. Made a simple demo which uses the same logic in following Steps.

# Step:- 1 Download Begins #

The normal download of your file begins using Alamofire 

# Step:- 2 Resume Download form the last know point #

In the normal case you need to store the last know resume data for this process. 
This resume data helps the App to detect where the download was last stop and can start from there.

# Step:- 3 Download Completed #

This depects that the downloaded has completed succesfully. In both the Case i.e. Full download or Partial Download

# Note:- I have also used the MBCircularProgressBar for showing the Progress.
